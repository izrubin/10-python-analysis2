Specifically, two poisson distributions are generated, one after the other, which creates a switchpoint. Eventually, he generates in total 250 year points, each corresponding to a \"cheese\" number forming two poisson distributions."

    "The model is similar to code mining disaster model from notebook 10.6. The model tries to approximate the one switch point where the rate is changed from early rate to late rate. To achieve this, the parameters `early_rate` and `late_rate` are set up using exponential distribution, and the parameter `switchpoint` is also specified its range. Then the switch system is set up by using `pm.math.switch`. Finally, the three model parameters (`early_rate`, `late_rate` and `switchpoint`) are fitted using the real data."

I think increasing iterations may better the model fit, and decrease the range of the 95% HPD intervals. Also I agree with the author that preparing better and larger dataset would make the model fit better."
